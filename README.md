# Loorna Game Engine V 0.1
A console based, extensible game engine written in C++.
This game engine aims to make developing games in a Console/Terminal simplier and more straightforward.
The engine focuses on single character "sprites" and some multi-char larger "sprites" but will not be as flexible as Playscii for example. 
Currently still learning so lots of stuff may change and there is still more to add. 
Anyone is welcome to come and configure the file to how you need it.

Roadmap coming soon...
